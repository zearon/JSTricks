<h3>Quick Start</h3>
<div>
	<p><a target="_blank"  href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/javascript-tricks/dpkgacdhagkgdhgmbfdhbmgdgnjibodb"><b>JavaScript Tricks</b></a> is a Chrome extension that works as a user script library and allows you to create, edit, and manage all your user scripts. With this extension, you can make your user scripts automatically get executed when you open some websites, or even every website, or when you click on certain context menu items. </p>
	
	<h4>Get Started</h4>
	<p>1. Open a website that you want to apply your user script, click on the extension icon on the Chrome toolbar. <br/>
	2. In the popup window displayed, follow the comment, like // YOUR CODE GOES HERE, and edit your source code in the editor under JavaScript tab. You can save your work any time by pressing Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S on Mac). <br/>
	3. If you want to inject some CSS styles, click on the CSS tab and edit your styles in the editor. <br/>
	4. Click on the Autostart button, and then refresh the webpage, and your script will get executed when webpage loaded.</p>
	<p>You can check the execution status by adding console.log(...) in your code and view the console in the development tools of Chrome. </p>
	
	
	<h4>Code Generation</h4>
	<p>In the popup window, there are three top level tabs, and under the JavaScript tab, there are a few second level tabs. The buttons in the tabs will help you generating some code snippets. Place the edit cursor at the place you want to insert the code in the editor, and click the button, the generated code will be inserted into your script. </p>
	<p>Frequently used codes are wrapped into functions and organized as modules. Each well-configured module appears as a second level tab under JavaScript tab. In every module tab, there is a <b>Init</b> button, which initializes the modules in the script, and any amount of other buttons which call functions in the module. Some of these buttons are followed by several input fields, whose values are arguments of the generated code.</p>
	<p>There are several built-in module shipped with this extension. Beside these modules, you can create your own module and configure them as code generation tools displayed in the popup window.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Context Menu</h4>
	<p>In the popup window, there are three top level tabs, and under the JavaScript tab, there are a few second level tabs. The buttons in the tabs will help you generating some code snippets. Place the edit cursor at the place you want to insert the code in the editor, and click the button, the generated code will be inserted into your script. All content scripts created in the options page will appear in the context menu. Clicking on the menu item will invoke the corresponding content script.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Options Page</h4>
	<p>In the options page, you can edit and manage all your user scripts, setting the option values, and backup your current configuration to or restore it from the local file system or a cloud storage system. The cloud storage system supported in this extension is a PHP application with only one .php file which can be easily deployed to your PHP web hosting environment if you have one. Besides, A JSON Viewer is provided for you to view your backup file.</p>

<h3>User Scripts</h3>
<div>
	<p>User Scripts are scripts that is provided by end users (i.e. the website users) rather than the websites designers, and aims at modifying the appearance or changing some behavior of the original websites, or perform specific tasks on them. </p>
	<p>According to the way scripts are invoked, user scripts in JavaScript Tricks can be classified into two categories:<br/>
	1. Site-Specific Scripts (or site scripts in short), and<br/>
	2. Dynamic Content Scripts (or content scripts in short)<br/></p>
	<p>A Site-Specific Script is loaded for and only for a specific domain, while Dynamic Content Scripts are invoked by other Site-Specific Scripts or when corresponding context menu items are clicked. Scripts in each categories can be edited and managed in corresponding tab in the options page, and Site-Specific Scripts can be created and edited in popup window as well.</p>
	
	<h4>Site-Specific Scripts</h4>
	<p>Site-Specific Scripts, or site scripts, are scripts supposed to be executed when webpages on certain websites with specific domain name are loaded. They are also attached with a CSS style code to be injected to the websites. A site script can only be created in the popup window. When you click the popup window icon on the Chrome tool bar and save the script by pressing Ctrl + S (or Cmd + S on Mac OS X), pressing the Save button or Autostart toggle button, a site script for the website is created. It can be edited in the popup window if only the same website is opened in the current tab. It can also be edited and managed in the options page under tab Site-Specific Scripts.</p>
	<p>For example, when www.bing.com in opened in the current tab, you open the popup window, add some javascript source code, add some CSS code, and then pressing the Autostart toggle button, a site script named "www.bing.com" will be created. The next time you open www.bing.com or refresh www.bing.com, the javascript code will be executed and the CSS code will be injected into the webpage. </p>
	<p>A common site script generated by the code template is like the following:</p>		
	<pre>
run(["ready"], function(ready) {
  function SiteScript() {	// for website www.bing.com
    // YOUR CODE GOES HERE
  }
  
  ready(SiteScript);
});	
	</pre>
	<p></p>
	
	<h5>Default Script</h5>
	<p>Default script is a kind of special site script. It is almost the same with regular site scripts except that it matches all domain names, i.e. it will be applied on any website.</p>
	<p>It can be temporarily disabled by setting its autostart attribute to false and enabled by setting its autostart attribute back to true.</p>
	
	<h5>Main Script</h5>
	<p>Main script is a very special script. Its CSS part has no sense. This is the very first script injected into in a tab, which is designed to do some initialization work, such as sea.js configuration, etc.</p>
	<p>It is hidden in default, and can be displayed by turning on the "Show Main script" switch in the options tab. It is advised that this script should be hidden after any modification in case of operation mistakes.</p>
